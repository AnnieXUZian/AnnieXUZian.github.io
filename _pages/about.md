Hello! I am a first-year Data Science Master student at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Data Science and Technology from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). 

On the professional front, I have interned at [TAL Education Group](https://en.100tal.com/) as a machine learning engineer, where I worked on developing automated data pipelines, optimizing predictive models and and contributed to enhancing [MathGPT](https://www.mathgpt.com/), a generative AI system for solving mathematical problems. I also have research experience in Large Language Models (ChatGPT, model evaluation) and Human-Computer Interaction (VR-interface, immersive visualization)[[GitHub]](https://github.com/stonycat/A-Case-of-Immersive-Data-Story). You can access the published work [[here]](http://localhost:8080/publications/). `I am currently actively seeking 2025 Summer internship in Software Engineering, Data Science, Full-stack Development.`

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
