abstract = {Informing people of health threats is crucial as they may lack situation awareness (SA) of risky situations when they do not have personal experiences or lessons learned from dangerous encounters. In this work, we explored the potential of using a VR data story to raise people's SA of health risks. We first invited seven participants and conducted participatory design studies to capture the design considerations. Then, we implemented the VR data story with five design features referring to the design considerations. Using a between-subjects study (N=62), we evaluated the effects of the data story on raising SA and investigated the role of each design feature. Our results show that the data story can promote SA by enhancing people's connection to risky situations. Design features such as immersive visualizations, multiple perspectives, and embodied interactions contribute to this connection. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative findings, we discuss the implications of designing data stories in VR for promoting public health.}

    abstract = "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has revolutionized general natural language preprocessing (NLP) tasks. However, their expertise in the financial domain lacks a comprehensive evaluation. To assess the ability of LLMs to solve financial NLP tasks, we present FinLMEval, a framework for Financial Language Model Evaluation, comprising nine datasets designed to evaluate the performance of language models. This study compares the performance of fine-tuned auto-encoding language models (BERT, RoBERTa, FinBERT) and the LLM ChatGPT. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT demonstrates notable performance across most financial tasks, it generally lags behind the fine-tuned expert models, especially when dealing with proprietary datasets. We hope this study builds foundation evaluation benchmarks for continuing efforts to build more advanced LLMs in the financial domain.",
